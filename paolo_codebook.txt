The Codebook describes the variables and labels

##1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

file:	 UCI HAR Dataset

training set:	xtrain :7352 rows, 561 columns
training labels	ytrain :7352 rows, 1 column
training set:	subjecttrain :7352 rows, 1 column

test set:	xtest :2947 rows, 561 columns
test labels: 	ytest :2947 rows, 1 column
test set:	subjecttest :2947 rows, 1 column

Merge set:	rawdata :10299 rows, 563 columns


##2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
measures:	features :1 row, 561 columns
measure names:	featureIndex :1 row, 66 columns

data :10299 rows, 68 columns

##3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

data$activity <- factor()
obs: change the numbers in activity column into the name of activities

##4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

a) All start with t replaced by Time
b) All start with f replaced by Frequency
c) All Acc replaced by Accelerometer
d) All Gyro replaced by Gyroscope
e) All Mag replaced by Magnitude
f) All brackets removed

##5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

tidydata : 	180 rows, 68 columns
