# Final_Assignment_module_3
This is the final assignment of the 3rd course of the R specialization

run paolo_script only if the UCI HAR Dataset file is in your working directory. The script follows the next steps:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The final output is a txt file named "paolo_meandata.txt"
